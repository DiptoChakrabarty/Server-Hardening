## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a Repository containing Server Hardening techniques which have been implemented using Ansible Roles.

I have created ansible roles for the following tasks
- accounts : this installs and configures fail2ban which helps in intrusion detection and system administrators can check illegal activities from logs
Also I have created a user ansible which is part of group power which I have given sudo powers

- network : Here we make ssh more secure by only allowing key based login , adding protocol 2 and limiting the number of tries , preventing TcpForwarding and etc
I have also added firewall rules to allow ssh access only from a particular network and only allow webserver access requests and removed all other rules

- physical : This provides security against single user mode and only allows login using password in the grub and also provides security against all types of physical attacks
Also changes grub settings .

-  luks-conf : make a harddisk encrypted for users and users will be able to store data securely and can decrypt it anytime using passphrase

The repository contains ansible vaults
All the vaults password is ansible

Along with that it contains a role for setting up and configuring docker and kubernetes in remote systems , the role name is kubernetes-docker
